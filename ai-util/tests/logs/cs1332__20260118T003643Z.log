Think about the specific steps required to insert a node at the beginning. Does the number of existing elements in the list change how many operations you have to perform?

Consider the steps to insert at the front: does the number of existing elements change how long it takes to update the head pointer?

2026-01-17 19:39:38,410 [INFO] Hint (Strategic) kind=hint type=Strategic
Think about the specific steps required to insert a node at the beginning of a linked list and whether those steps depend on the number of elements already in the list.

Think about the specific steps needed to add a new node: create the node, point its 'next' reference to the current head, and update the head pointer. Does the number of existing elements (n) change how long these steps take?

2026-01-17 19:39:44,819 [INFO] Hint (Bottom-Out / Explicit) kind=hint type=Bottom-Out / Explicit
The tightest Big-O bound is O(1) because adding to the front only requires creating a new node and updating the head pointer, which takes a constant number of steps regardless of the list size.
