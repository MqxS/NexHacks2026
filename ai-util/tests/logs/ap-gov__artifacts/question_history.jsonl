The student's work is provided as 'student_step'. The original problem is provided as 'question'.\n\nYour task is to determine if 'student_step' is a logically correct and necessary next step towards solving the 'question'.\n\n**Validation Rules:**\n1. **Numeric Correctness:** The numerical result of the step must be mathematically correct based on the previous state (if applicable) or the initial problem.\n2. **Unit Robustness:** Accept the step if the numeric value is correct, even if the unit is missing, abbreviated, or slightly different (e.g., '5 m/s', '5 meters per second', '5' are all acceptable if 5 is the correct number for that quantity). \n3. **Unit Error:** Mark as incorrect if the unit is fundamentally wrong (e.g., the answer should be in meters but the step shows kilograms).\n4. **Logical Flow:** The step must follow logically from the preceding context (if provided) or be a valid initial manipulation of the problem.\n\n**Output Format:** Return a single JSON object with the following keys:\n- \"ok\": boolean (true if the step is valid according to the rules, false otherwise).\n- \"error_type\": string or null. If \"ok\" is false, specify the error type (e.g., \"Arithmetic Error\", \"Unit Mismatch\", \"Logical Flaw\"). If \"ok\" is true, this must be null.\n- \"feedback\": string. A brief, constructive explanation of the validation result. If incorrect, explain the specific error. If correct, state that the step is valid.", "created_at_iso": "2026-01-18T05:58:45.500561+00:00"}
