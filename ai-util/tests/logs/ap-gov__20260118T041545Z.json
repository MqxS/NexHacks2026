Confirm if the student correctly identifies Option B. 2. Verify that the student's logic correctly identifies the specific branches involved (Executive and Legislative). 3. Ensure the student does not confuse 'checks and balances' with 'federalism' (Option C) or 'separation of powers' in a vacuum. 4.
