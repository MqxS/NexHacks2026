    "What is the Big-O time complexity for adding an element to the middle index of an ArrayList?",
    "What is the Big-O time complexity for adding an element to the back of a CircularSinglyLinkedList?",
    "What is the Big-O time complexity for adding an element to the third-to-last spot in a DoublyLinkedList?",
    "What is the average case Big-O time complexity for adding an element that is larger than every other data in a Binary Search Tree (BST)?",
    "What is the Big-O time complexity for removing the oldest element from a Stack using the pop operation?",
    "What is the Big-O time complexity for Enqueueing an element to a LinkedList-backed Queue?",
    "What is the Big-O time complexity for Searching for a value in a BST?",
    "Krispy Kreme needs a data structure to track donuts where customers can take either the hottest (newest) or the coldest (oldest) donut, but not one in the middle. Which data structure best represents the donuts?",
    "You want to track candy collected (only taking from the top) and model the line of trick-or-treaters at each house (must wait until you receive candy). Which combination of data structures best represents your candy bucket and the lines of trick-or-treaters waiting at each house?",
    "What operations would a DoublyLinkedList with only a tail pointer perform faster than a SinglyLinkedList with both a head pointer and a tail pointer? Select all that apply.",
    "The Hamby Corporation needs a record system where lookups are rare, but hundreds of items are added every minute, requiring fast additions. What structure should they use to optimize adding items fast?",
    "You need to store and increment the number of operations completed by many CPUs (indexed 0, 1, 2, ...), where counts go up rapidly. What data structure could store each CPU's count efficiently?",
    "You are designing software to track the movement of trains on the circular perimeter of Atlanta, needing to store each train relative to its adjacent trains in a loop. What data structure can naturally represent a loop of trains?",
    "A virus infects one computer, then infects two other systems before shutting down the original, and you want a graphical representation of this spread. Which data structure is suitable?",
    "In a delivery dispatch system, requests are added in the order received and must be delivered in that exact order for fairness. What data structure would best support this?",
    "You are designing an undo/redo system for a drawing app, supporting efficient undo (reversing the last action) and redo (reapplying a previously undone action). Which data structure would be best for supporting both operations efficiently?"
