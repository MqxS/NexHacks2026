Evaluate the student's step-by-step reasoning for the question: 'What is the tightest Big-O bound for adding to the front of a SinglyLinkedList?'. The correct answer is O(1) because it involves creating a new node and updating the head pointer, which does not depend on the size of the list. If the student suggests O(n), check if they are incorrectly assuming the list must be traversed. If they suggest O(log n), check for misconceptions regarding tree-based structures. Return a JSON object with: 'ok' (boolean), 'error_type' (string or null), and 'feedback' (string). Do not provide the final answer if the student is still working through the steps.", "created_at_iso": "2026-01-18T00:39:13.538334+00:00"}
