Krispy Kreme needs to track their supply of donuts. They add fresh donuts to stock, which cool at the same rate. Customers may take the hottest, freshest donut or the coldest, most aged donut, but not those in the middle. Which data structure best represents the donuts? Options: Queue, Deque, DoublyLinkedList, Heap.

You want to track candy collected (taking only from the very top) and model a line of trick-or-treaters (who do not leave until they receive candy). Which combination of data structures best represents the candy bucket and the lines? Options: Stack and Queue, Stack and Deque, Heap and Queue, Heap and Deque.

What operations would a DoublyLinkedList with only a tail pointer perform faster than a SinglyLinkedList with both a head pointer and a tail pointer? Select all that apply: addToFront(), addToBack(), addThirdFromBack(), removeFromBack().

A corporation wants a record system where lookups are rare, but hundreds of items are added every minute. Even one slow addition is costly. What structure should they use to optimize adding items fast? Options: ArrayList, SinglyLinkedList, Deque, BST.

You have various CPUs numbered 0, 1, 2, ... and want to store and increment the number of operations each completes. Counts go up rapidly. What data structure could store each CPU's count efficiently? Options: ArrayList, SinglyLinkedList, Queue, BST.

A city planner wants to track the movement of trains on a circular perimeter. You need to store each train relative to the trains adjacent to it. What data structure can naturally represent a loop of trains? Options: ArrayList, LinkedList, CircularSinglyLinkedList, Binary Tree.

A virus is programmed to infect exactly two other systems before shutting the original computer down. Which data structure is suitable for a graphical representation of the virus as it travels through computers? Options: ArrayList, LinkedList, CircularSinglyLinkedList, Binary Tree.

Delivery requests are added in the order they are received and must be delivered in that exact order. What data structure would best support this? Options: Array, Stack, Queue, Deque.

You are designing an undo/redo system for a drawing app. Users can undo their last action or redo a previously undone action. Which data structure would be best for supporting both operations efficiently? Options: BST, Stack, Queue, Deque.
